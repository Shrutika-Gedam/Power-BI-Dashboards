Key Features
* Interactive Dashboard: The `.pbix` file is a fully functional Power BI report with interactive visuals and slicers, allowing users to explore data at a high level or drill down into specific details.
* Time-Series Analysis: The dashboard includes visuals like line charts with trend lines to show air quality trends over time (daily, monthly, and yearly).
* Geospatial Visualization: A filled map is used to show the geographical distribution of air quality, with cities color-coded based on their average AQI values.
* Data Consolidation: The Power BI file demonstrates a best practice of data consolidation using Power Query to append multiple monthly data files (`.csv` or `.xlsx`) into a single, clean table for analysis.
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The dashboard features cards to display key metrics such as the average AQI, total cities, and total pollutants, providing a quick summary of the data.
